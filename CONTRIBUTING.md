2.  **Complete Objectives** & provide proof (Screenshot/PR).
3.  **Get Review** & Merge.
4.  **Earn XP**, Loot, and Level Up.

## 🚫 5. The Code of Conduct (Anti-Gaming)
1.  **No Grinding:** Low-effort PRs (e.g., fixing one typo per PR) will be closed without XP. Consolidate small fixes.
2.  **Quality First:** XP is only awarded for *merged* PRs that pass CI/CD.
3.  **Be Nice:** We are here to vibe. Rudeness = Ban.
