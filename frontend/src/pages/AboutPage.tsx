      <p className="mb-4">
        Web Hatchery is a fun AI playground â€” a space where I share experiments, games, apps, stories, and anything else AI-related that I find interesting. Think of it as a collection of prototypes and ideas, some polished, some rough, but all open to explore.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Everything here is free. You're welcome to:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Browse and try out projects.</li>
        <li>Take the code and use it in your own work.</li>
        <li>Contribute improvements or build your own version.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The only request is attribution â€” please credit Web Hatchery if you reuse the work.

        Donations are welcome via Ko-fi, but they're never required.

        Eggs are Web Hatchery's playful little currency. You'll receive some eggs every day just for visiting. You can spend them to:

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Request new features</li>
        <li>Boost existing feature requests to raise their priority</li>

      <p>
        The more eggs a feature has, the more likely it is to be built.
